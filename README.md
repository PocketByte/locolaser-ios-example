# LocoLaser iOS Example
LocoLaser - Localozation tool for Android and iOS. See https://github.com/PocketByte/LocoLaser/ for more details.
<br>This example project shows how to use localization in iOS.

##### 1 Step: Add Bash script
Example has a special Bash scripts in folder `"./locloaser-example-ios/"`. You can copy them without changes in your project in the folder with sources. There are 3 files:
- **`localize.command`** - Run LocoLaser with default parameters;
- **`localizeForce.command`** - Run LocoLaser with flag `--force`;
- **`localizeExportNew.command`** - Run LocoLaser with flag `--force` and `conflict strategy = export_new_platform`.

##### 2 Step: Choose artifact
You are able to choose which type of tool you will to use by setting a special variables in `localize.command`. There are `ARTIFACTS` variable that respons to LocoLaser artifact. For Mobile platform and Google Sheets source use following artifacts:
- **`ru.pocketbyte.locolaser:core:1.2.1`** - Mandatory artifact that contains common LocoLaser logic;
- **`ru.pocketbyte.locolaser:platform-mobile:1.2.1`** - Artifact that has logic of how to work with mobile platform configuration;
- **`ru.pocketbyte.locolaser:source-googlesheet:1.2.1`** - Artifact that has logic of how to work with Google Sheets source configuration.

Leave bash scripts without changes if you want to use Google Sheets as a source in your XCode project.

##### 3 Step: Add LocoLaser config
Place your `"localization_config.json"` in the folder with sources. In example it's `"./locloaser-example-ios/"`. You can read more about config file content in the following repository: https://github.com/PocketByte/LocoLaser/.
<br>You can change name and location of config file by changing variable **`CONFIG_FILE`** in `localize.command`.

##### 4 Step: Run localization
All preparation are done. To run localization you should run coresponded bash script.
<br> If you wish, you able to run LocoLaser before each build. To do it you should add **Run Script** to your project. For example:
``` Bash
./locloaser-example-ios/localize.command
```
This **Run Script** should be exuted **IMMEDIATELY** after phase **Target Dependencies**. If this script run later it can lead to undesirable consequences.
